This project is based on the URL https://github.com/udacity/dog-project?tab=readme-ov-file for implementation in the PyTorch framework. 
It's a CNN model for classification, quite interesting. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify and estimate the breed of the dog. If the provided image is of a person, the code will identify the closest dog breed.
